<center><h1> A Short Biography </h1></center>

<h3>January 15, 1996</h3>
<center><p>I was born in Austin, TX to Judy and Tim Wainwright. My older sister, Kaitlin, was not as thrilled of my arrival. She is three years older than me. Here is a picture of us now! </p></center>

<h3>January 20, 1997</h3>
<center><p>I moved to Orlando, FL. Okay, so maybe I made up the EXACT date, but I do know it was in the month of January! My family and I moved to Sanford, FL which is a suburb of Orlando for my Dad's work. Living 45 min away from Disney was definitely the best thing in the world, especially as a 5 year old.</p></center>

<h3>May 1, 2002</h3>
<center><p>My family and I moved to Cary, NC! This is where I spent my childhood from age 6 until I came to college! As a kid, I would spend most of my time playing outdoor games with the neighborhood friends or playing one of the many sports I was involved in, whether it be swimming, soccer, softball, or gymnastics. Cary was a great place to grow up, right in between the beach and the mountains! We got a new member of the family when I was 7-a cockerspaniel poodle mix named George! Here is a picture of him! </p></center>

<h3>June 12-27, 2014</h3>
<center><p> After graduation, I went on a senior class trip to Greece! One of the teachers at Green Hope plans the trip every year and it was amazing! We went to Athens, Santorini, Ios, Paros, and Mykonos. We were there for 15 days and about 50 of us went. It was an awesome way to end high school. Below is one of my favorite pictures from the whole trip!</p></center>

<h3>August 23, 2014-Present</h3>
<center> The fall after graduation, I came to UNC Chapel Hill as a freshman! I had always wanted to study here and when I was accepted, I knew this was where I'd end up. Now I'm a junior and I can't believe how quickly my first two years here went by! I do not feel like I should be an upper-classman already! My years as a freshman and sophomore were so much fun, and this year is turning out to be even better! My freshman year I lived in Horton dorm with my high school friend Hannah. My sophomore year I lived in Winston with her as well and now I live in a house off-campus with 5 other girls. I'm majoring in Mathematical Decision Sciences and Economics (with a minor in Information Science) and I hope to go into the field of data analytics/data science. So far at UNC, I've become involved in various things including CADS, Carolina Analytics and Data Science, CUAB, Carolina Union Activities Board, Nourish Ventures Committee, and intramural soccer! Below is a picture of me at Sup Dogs watching the UNC-Duke game last year--sadly, the one we lost :( . </center>
