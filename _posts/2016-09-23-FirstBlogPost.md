This is my first blog post on my website! I've learned a bunch in this class so far. For starters, I have a much better understanding of computer systems (i.e. clients, servers, networks) as a whole than before I came into this class. I've also learned how to navigate GitHub fairly well, both understanding how to make commit changes, how to view the changes live without commiting them, and how to navigate through the GitHub directories. I've also been able to learn a little bit about HTML and CSS which are both very useful knowledge for front-end developing! I'm excited to learn even more in this class in the weeks to come :)
