This is my first blog post on my website! Welcome.. Hope this isn't too boring to read. If you're wondering, I made this by first running my code with the jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT command. Then, I changed directories into the Gravity directory ( cd Gravity). Then, I created a new post by entering touch 2016-09-23-FirstBlogPost.md Hope I don't forget all of that!
