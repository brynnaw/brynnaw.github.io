Hello everyone! I have returned! So I thought I'd share some helpful information that I used to design this website! I'll start off with Git:

# GitCommands

* git log
* git status
* git checkout TestBranch
* git add FileName
* git commit -m "Commit Name"
* git merge master
* git push origin master

Here are some helpful resources if I ever get stuck or want to learn something new. These are good for learning more HTML, Mardown, and CSS.
