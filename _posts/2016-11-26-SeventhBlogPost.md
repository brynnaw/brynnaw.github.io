# 3D Printing Workshop

For my second community event, I went to a 3D printing workshop! Here at UNC we have a ‘Makerspace’ which is basically an area for all students to come and explore their creativity! They have many things there from workshops on how to make a duct tape wallet all the way to things like 3D scanning and visualization. These spaces are becoming popular in communities and on college campuses and they work to create an inspiring and creative environment. [Here is the link to UNC’s makerspace website](http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/)

## What I learned

I was actually the only person to attend the workshop so I got a personalized introduction into 3D printing! So apparently the 3D printers process files in a “.stl” format and that can be created in various 3D design programs such as 

* Tinkercad
* Maya 

OR you can download an already created .stl file that someone else already created. This was recommended for users that were new to the topic. Here are some awesome resources for finding .stl files 

* Thingiverse.com
* NASA
* Smithsonian

After browsing through some of these options on the websites previously listed, the instructor took me through some design considerations when making your own .stl file. 

## Design Considerations

* Infill- this refers to the density of the plastic when filling out the inside of objects. You can change this setting to make the object more or less dense. This is important to consider if you are making an object that you want to float or fly for example.
* Support material- this refers to the ability of the machine to make certain shaped objects. For example, the printer can’t simply print something in thin air without having support from the ground. In this case, the printer will recognize this before the printing begins and create its own support system starting from the bottom of the object and working its way up. These are possible to remove either by cutting off or, if the machine is capable, it creates the support material out of a dissolvable plastic that will automatically come off when soaked in the correct fluid.
* Depth- this refers to the ability of the machine to only make 3D objects. When designing things on a computer it can be easy to not realize when there is no type of depth in a certain part of the object you are creating. This means the object is only 2 dimensional at some points and the machine will not be able to print that object. 

## Conclusion

All in all, the workshop was super informative! The only interaction I previously had regarding 3D printing was the knowledge I had about a certain club at UNC that one of my friends is in. This club works to create hands from 3D printers that disabled children can wear and use before they receive real biotic hands. The instructor encouraged me to submit a request to have an object created from 3D printing. This service is free for all students up to a certain amount of plastic per month and not many people make use of this resource! I look forward to using the Makerspace going forward in my academic career!
