# Hi friends!

I'm finally getting the hang of this whole "programming" thing! And that's good because this assignment is due tonight by midnight. Below you'll find a little summary of the cool features I've included for Assignment#2:

* <h1> Home Page </h1> - This includes a chronological view of all of my posts! You can see my progression of understanding of the material in each post.
* <h1> About Me Page </h1> - This page includes a short timeline of my life followed by some information about my hobbies, my likes/dislikes, and favorite things!
* <h1> Projects </h1> - Here is where you'll find all the information about my final project submissions. There isn't anything in that tab yet because we haven't been assigned another project!
* <h1> Some Extra Stuff </h1> - This page includes a bunch of random things that I wanted to have on my website that doesn't actually belong in a category. Take a look if you're curious--you won't be dissapointed!
