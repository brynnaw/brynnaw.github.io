**First Community Development: Artificial Intelligence Talk**


Ever since my first interactions with artificial intelligence and machine learning 
during my internship at MetLife, my curiosity regarding this topic has remained insatiable. 
Before the summer, I had little to no knowledge about what this area of study entailed. 
However, during a technology expo which featured multiple talks from various companies that 
MetLife works with, I learned about an artificial intelligence technology that MetLife is 
developing and was able to witness a live demonstration and walkthrough of the technology 
behind it. After that I immediately researched various other artificial intelligence success
stories including IBM’s Watson, Microsoft’s Tay, and Google’s AlphaGo. My interest in this 
topic is what drew me towards attending the Infusion Tech Talk: Artificial Intelligence 
located in Sitterson 014 on October 13 at 5:30. 

During this talk, Infusion leader outlined the basics of artificial 
intelligence followed by application examples before ending with possible
risks associated with further advancement in the field. 

# Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the utilization of neural networks and deep 
learning to reach a new level of computational accuracy in many fields. If that 
doesn’t make sense, here is a textbook definition of neural networks: 

"Neural networks, also referred to as connectionist systems, are a computational
approach which is based on a large collection of neural units loosely modeling 
the way the brain solves problems with large clusters of biological neurons 
connected by axons.""

Deep learning is the process of using these neural networks to apply to a problem 
or skill. While I still don’t *fully* understand the basics behind it, here is a
picture that helped me gauge the big picture idea.

# Applications

These AI’s are being used in photo recognition, language comprehension and translation,
gaming (i.e. Jeopardy, Chess, Go), and business inefficiencies. For instance, AI’s are
able to analyze a picture and relay back to the user different possible items within 
the picture with an associated level of probability. They can even relay back to the 
user in a complete sentence what the picture is portraying. Additionally, These computers 
are increasing the accuracy of digital language translation by making the output more
human-like and readable. What I find the most fascinating is the ability of these AI’s 
to beat the BEST in the WORLD humans in games like Jeopardy, Chess, and Go. Take IBM’s
Watson who in 2011 beat the world’s two most successful player’s, Ken Jennings and Brad
Rutter using 4 terabytes of disk storage and 200 million pages of content. And, even
more recently and astonishing, Google’s AlphaGo which beat the world’s best Go player, 
Lee Sedol, in a 4-1 victory in March of this year. This was particularly suprising 
because of the sheer complexity of the game. To put this in perspective, the branching
factor of chess is a mere 35 compared to Go’s 250. I’ll use another textbook definition 
if you aren’t familiar with this term.

“In computing, tree data structures, and game theory, the branching factor is the number
of children at each node, the outdegree. For example, in chess, if a "node" is considered
to be a legal position, the average branching factor has been said to be about 35. This
means that, on average, a player has about 35 legal moves at his disposal at each turn.
By comparison, the branching factor for the game Go is 250.”

One last example of applications of AI’s include the cost saving potential. For instance,
Google used the DeepMind AI to find more efficient ways of heating and cooling it’s data 
centers in order to minimize power bills. The AI ended up cutting Google’s power bill by 
a total of 15%! This is huge especially when you realize how much data Google controls-
Google used a total of 4,402,836 MWh of electricity in 2014. 

# Conclusion

Basically, the area of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks is 
becoming increasingly powerful with today’s technology. I personally learned an incredible
amount from the hour and a half long talk (during which I didn’t fall asleep once which is
impressive considering I was on 2 hours of sleep from the night before). Being a statistics
and economics major, this talk has encouraged me to gain increased experience in the realm
of computer science to hopefully one day understand even more of this topic.

**Second Community Development: 3D Printing Workshop**

# 3D Printing Workshop

For my second community event, I went to a 3D printing workshop! Here at UNC we have a ‘Makerspace’ which is basically an area for all students to come and explore their creativity! They have many things there from workshops on how to make a duct tape wallet all the way to things like 3D scanning and visualization. These spaces are becoming popular in communities and on college campuses and they work to create an inspiring and creative environment. [Here is the link to UNC’s makerspace website](http://library.unc.edu/makerspace/)

## What I learned

I was actually the only person to attend the workshop so I got a personalized introduction into 3D printing! So apparently the 3D printers process files in a “.stl” format and that can be created in various 3D design programs such as 

* Tinkercad
* Maya 

OR you can download an already created .stl file that someone else already created. This was recommended for users that were new to the topic. Here are some awesome resources for finding .stl files 

* Thingiverse.com
* NASA
* Smithsonian

After browsing through some of these options on the websites previously listed, the instructor took me through some design considerations when making your own .stl file. 

## Design Considerations

* Infill- this refers to the density of the plastic when filling out the inside of objects. You can change this setting to make the object more or less dense. This is important to consider if you are making an object that you want to float or fly for example.
* Support material- this refers to the ability of the machine to make certain shaped objects. For example, the printer can’t simply print something in thin air without having support from the ground. In this case, the printer will recognize this before the printing begins and create its own support system starting from the bottom of the object and working its way up. These are possible to remove either by cutting off or, if the machine is capable, it creates the support material out of a dissolvable plastic that will automatically come off when soaked in the correct fluid.
* Depth- this refers to the ability of the machine to only make 3D objects. When designing things on a computer it can be easy to not realize when there is no type of depth in a certain part of the object you are creating. This means the object is only 2 dimensional at some points and the machine will not be able to print that object. 

## Conclusion

All in all, the workshop was super informative! The only interaction I previously had regarding 3D printing was the knowledge I had about a certain club at UNC that one of my friends is in. This club works to create hands from 3D printers that disabled children can wear and use before they receive real biotic hands. The instructor encouraged me to submit a request to have an object created from 3D printing. This service is free for all students up to a certain amount of plastic per month and not many people make use of this resource! I look forward to using the Makerspace going forward in my academic career!
